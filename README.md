# Drug-Performance-Evaluation
This dataset contains drug performance metrics for 37 common conditions, so it can be used to compare and analyze the effectiveness, cost, and satisfaction of different drugs.
To get started using this dataset, let’s look at the columns. The Variables to consider are:
•	Medical Condition: e.g. diabetes, Hypertention, etc.
•	Drug Name: Generic name (not trade name)
•	Ease of use:  grade from 0 to 5
•	Effective: grade from 0 to 5
•	Satisfaction: grade from 0 to 5
•	Pharmaceutical form: Tablet, Capsule, liquid, etc.
•	Indication: 1- on-label: means approved to be used for specific medical conition.
•	2-off-label: Unapproved to be used for specific condition, e.g. using of metformin (antidiabetic drug) for weight loss
•	Type, reviews and price
Now that we have identified all the important figures we can begin analyzing our data set. A great first step is to make use of descriptive statistics such as mean or median values for each column in order to get an idea on how various drugs perform with regards to effectiveness or cost etcetera. We also might want group our data indexed based on condition – that way comparing drugs would be simpler based on what they treat! Additionally grouping by type and form can also help provide meaningful insights into our data set allowing us to gain greater understanding about various drug responses across different forms/types available for different conditions (e.g capsules vs pills versus injections). Comparing performance metrics amongst groups created this way will enable us draw correlations between cost effectiveness ratios and satisfaction rates towards certain types/forms of drugs compared with others treating similar diseases or health concerns!
Finally “Reviews” are a key component any analysis involving drug performance ratings – while they do not necessarily correspond directly towards efficacy; they play a vital measuring stick when it comes consumer perceptions regarding certain medications – both good and bad alike! Overall understanding how these reviews & ratings interact with all other factors provides us great insight into medication reception thereby aiding potential health news coverage as well making informed decisions related medical purchases & usage across consumer level demographics!
